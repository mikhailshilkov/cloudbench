# Mediumish Theme

This theme for gohugo is a customized port based on the [Mediumish Jekyll-Theme](//github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll) by [WowThemesNet](//github.com/wowthemesnet). The original theme ships with a few more features than this ported version but i also added features which the original version did not include.

See the [Demo](https://lgaida.github.io/mediumish-gohugo-theme-demo) and [Demo-Source](https://github.com/lgaida/mediumish-gohugo-theme-demo)

## Installation
Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

    $ cd themes
    $ git clone https://github.com/lgaida/mediumish-gohugo-theme

## Preface
Most of the images e.g logo, author-image, post-images should be placed somewhere in the static folder of your gohugo-site. You can then reference them via the config.toml or the post.md-files. I would suggest placing all your config-specific images under `static/images` and all post-related images under a arbitrary folder like `static/images/posts`.
However your folder-structure will be there is one exception: you need a file named `jumbotron.jpg` to be present under `static/images` since this one is referenced in the .css

## Post Example
To create a simple post use the hugo new command as usual.
```
hugo new blog/my-first-post.md
```

You then have a few options which i want to point out in the following.
```
---
title: "My first post"
date: 2018-10-01T15:25:19+02:00
publishdate: 2018-10-07T11:17:14+02:00
lastmod: 2018-10-08T18:55:29+02:00
image: "/images/Test.jpg"
tags: ["post", "interesting"]
type: "post"
comments: false
---
# Lorem ipsum
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aenean semper libero quis dictum dapibus. Nulla egestas vitae augue eu rutrum. Duis ullamcorper dictum ipsum. Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum primis in faucibus. Suspendisse tortor dui, fermentum non dapibus id, volutpat non odio.
```

`publishdate`: is displayed at the top of the single-view\
`lastmod`: is displayed as a hint on the single-view\
`image`: is displayed in the list- and single-view\
`tags`: are used as usual, just add the tags you want to use. They are displayed in the jumbotron on the list-view, and on the bottom of each single-view\
`comments`: true/false to turn on/off disqus-comments


## Static Content
I added a customized layout for content of type "static", which means that posts in the folder "static" are displayed as standalone pages. I also disabled the list-layout for this folder.

For example: to create an imprint, simply go with the following command and add your markdown-text.
```
hugo new static/imprint.md
```

## Configuration
You should at least specify the following default params in your config.toml
```toml
baseURL = "http://yourdomain.com"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "Mediumish"
theme = "mediumish-gohugo-theme"
summaryLength = 25
copyright = "John Doe - All rights reserved"
disqusShortname = "shortDisquis"
googleAnalytics = "UA-1XXXXXXX1-X"
```
`title`: is displayed on the postlist and on each post as the title\
`summaryLength`: feel free to play around with this\
`copyright`: is displayed in the footer next to the copyright-logo\
`disqusShortname`: provide your disqusShortname\
`googleAnalytics`: provide your googleAnalytics-Code

### General Params
```toml
[params]
  logo = "/images/icon.png"
  description ="the clean blog!"
  mailchimp = "you can provide a mailchimp-link here, see below"
  mailprotect = "you can provide a protector-name here, see below"
```
`logo`: is displayed in titlebar and alertbar\
`description`: is displayed under title\
`mailchimp` and `mailprotect`: provide links to a mailchimp-list and a mailchimp-protector id, the following screenshot should clarify

[params.author]
  name = "John Doe"

**This textblock is a demonstration of the mdtext-param.**\
### This is a markdown heading'''
  alertbar = true
```
You can currently provide your username from `github`, `linkedin`, `xing`, `twitter`, `medium`. They will be displayed as icons on the landingpage.
```toml
[params.social]
  github = "<username>"
  linkedin = "<username>"
  xing = "<username>"
